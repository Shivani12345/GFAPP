                        I’m…<br>

                        And <br>

                        I’m….<br>

                        We’re going to spend two minutes discussing your roles as faith leaders in helping to deal with human trafficking in Ghana.<br>

                        We’re also going to discuss how to talk about this crime to your congregants.<br>

                        As faith leaders, you have a very special position in Ghanaian society.<br>

                        You see into the hearts of communities – into places where government agencies, and the police cannot reach.<br>

                        You can see changes in people that would pass many others by.<br>

                        And you understand what poverty and desperation can do to men, women and children.<br>

                        So you are uniquely placed to identify victims, and help victims.<br>

                        By putting them in touch with professionals who can help them. And who can help deal with the perpetrators.
<br>
                        While all crimes break the trust between people and society, human trafficking is an especially heinous crime.<br>

                        This because it involves the exploitation and abuse of human beings for profit. 
<br>
                        In practice, trafficking most often involves people being exploited for sex – or for cheap or abusive labour.<br>

                        In Ghana it is outlawed under the 2005 Human Trafficking Act.<br>

                        It is a crime which has fallen foul of religious doctrine for centuries.
<br>
                        Both our religions treat this crime in a similar way. Both denounce it in the clearest possible terms, and both religions have played a vital role in shaping how society deals with these crimes.<br>
                          
                        Christian beliefs shaped the abolition of slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries, and have helped influence legislation against trafficking – in particular sex trafficking – in many countries.<br>

                        Islamic law explicitly prohibits many of the acts that constitute trafficking in persons as well as sexual exploitation for profit. The anti-slavery roots of Islam run deep. Islam’s first mu'azzin, chosen by the Prophet Muhammad himself, was a former slave Bilal ibn Rabah, born in Mecca in 580. Bilal was tortured by his slave master for embracing Islam, and the Prophet Muhammad subsequently arranged his emancipation. <br>

                        As you can see from the information on this app, trafficking takes place within Ghana and across Ghana’s borders. In both cases – cross border and domestic – it can involve exploitation of people for sex or for labour.<br>

                        Within Ghana, a common area of exploitation is the fishing industry in Lake Volta, where children from across Ghana – often coastal communities – are taken to the lake, and work in what are often terrible, dangerous conditions.<br>

                        This is an obvious case of trafficking.<br>

                        But there are also less obvious cases than the fishing industry, or the sex industry.<br>

                        Like the domestic worker, bussed down from the north by an agent, who is paid abusive wages.<br>

                        A very large number of trafficking cases in Ghana involve family members as alleged traffickers or accomplices.<br>

                        It can become very difficult to disentangle cases of desperation and survival – which possibly do not breach the Act – with cases that are more clearly morally reprehensible and unlawful.<br>

                        As faith leaders you’re ideally placed to exercise the judgment necessary to identify the cases where you believe the line might have been crossed and the authorities need to be alerted. So that the victim can be assisted, and the perpetrators pursued.<br>

                        You need to use both vigilance and empathy to root out the true victims of these crimes.  <br>

                        Because poverty is such a frequent backdrop to trafficking, careful thought should be given to how to discuss it publicly. To combine the clear declaration that trafficking is immoral, illegal and a violation of our faiths – while also expressing sympathy for some of the reasons people make such terrible choices. These boil down to poverty and desperation.
<br>
                        In conclusion we advise that if you haven’t already, you familiarise yourself with the clear definition of trafficking contained in Ghana’s laws – you can find it on the app menu – as well as the introductory information on this app, and the references to further information if required.<br>

                        And use this knowledge to look afresh at members of your congregation who you believe might be in a perilous situation.
<br>

                        It goes without saying that we would never advise taking the law into your own hands. 
<br>
                        But rather to use the government hotlines and the resources and contact numbers provided in this app to give members of your congregation the professional support that they need when you think they need it.
<br>
                        You are the bridge between victims of a terrible crime and the state, uniquely placed to put a spotlight on these crimes. And we urge you take the opportunities that present themselves when talking to your congregants to spread awareness and understanding about these crimes. <br>
