                        It can be difficult to identify trafficking victims.
                    </p>
                    <p>The key signs to look out for are: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People in very difficult or dangerous working conditions</li>
                        <li>And away from home</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Typically, victims are forced into sexual servitude - or made to work in
                        extremely poor conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As illustrated below, the fishing sector is the most well known area of the
                        economy where there are ongoing reports of trafficking - both of children
                        made to work, and then women trafficked to serve fishermen as domestic or
                        sexual workers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means faith leaders familiar with their congregants’ lives are well
                        placed to identify real victims.

                    <h4 class="padding-top-30">Case study</h4>
                    <p>This case study charts a typical example of domestic trafficking. It involves
                        the exploitation of a young girl from the north who was forced to work in
                        Accra as a domestic worker, in intolerable conditions. </p>
                    <p>The case study shows how family networks can overlap with trafficking
                        networks. The case study also shows how everyday domestic situations – as
                        opposed to more obvious examples of organised trafficking – can mask what is
                        criminal abuse in terms of Ghana’s trafficking legislation</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>At the age of 13, Kay’s parents arranged for her to be a domestic worker
                            with a family in Accra.Her parents lined up the job through a broker
                            called “Aunty Aba”, who in turn used another broker, “Sister Evelyn.”
                        </li>
                        <li>Once in Accra, Kay was mistreated consistently, and beaten regularly.
                        </li>
                        <li>Kay said she told her mother she would continue her education at school
                            in Accra, and that everything would be OK.
                        </li>
                        <li>But far from being treated well, she was subjected to cruel treatment on
                            a regular basis, and beaten for the slightest reason.
                        </li>
                        <li>Kay said: “Sometimes when I do something bad, then the madam will slap
                            me [crying]. If she sends me, and I come back and I don’t bring the
                            right thing, she slaps me... There was a day I went to bath, when I
                            finished bathing, there was blood in the bath and I didn’t know. She
                            called me and ask why. By the time I explain, she slapped me.”
                        </li>
                        <li>Her family did not help her. If Kay complained to her employer’s
                            husband, he would blame her. Her employer eventually asked Kay’s family
                            to take her back.
                        </li>
                        <li>But Kay’s father didn’t rescue her. Instead, he pleaded with the family
                            to keep Kay.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
