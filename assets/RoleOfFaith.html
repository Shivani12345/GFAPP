                    <p>Faith leaders have a very special position in society from which they can
                        play a crucial role combatting modern slavery. They see into the hearts of
                        communities â€“ into places where government agencies, and the police cannot
                        reach. They see changes in people that would pass many others by. This makes
                        them uniquely placed to identify victims, and help victims.</p>
