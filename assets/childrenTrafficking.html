                        Children can be victims of domestic trafficking.
                    </p>
                    <p>What to watch out for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Away from home</li>
                        <li>Signs of violence</li>
                        <li>No access to education</li>
                        <li>Long work hours</li>
                        <li>Dangerous work</li>
                        <li>Bad living conditions or no shelter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        But faith leaders need to be careful when seeking to help potential child
                        victims.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some children are sent to live away from home with extended family members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There they could work lawfully if the work is reasonable it is lawful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This tradition can be abused, and children exploited. In that case, the
                        child could be being treated unlawfully – and possibly trafficked.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example – Lake Volta </h4>
                    <p>
                        There is a lot of child labour in the fishing industry on Lake Volta.
                        <br><br>
                        Many of the children are trafficked. It’s estimated that at least half the
                        children working there are trafficked.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/Children.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>
                        In a typical example, children are sent from their homes – often from the
                        coast – to the lake.<br><br>
                        There they work for fishermen, who in turn pay the children’s parents.
                        <br><br>
                        Children work on the shore to prepare fish. They also fix nets that get
                        tangled in trees. There’ve been reports of children drowning after being
                        trapped.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h4 class="title">Trafficked or not?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The key difference with trafficked children is their parents often give them
                        to fishermen or intermediary recruiters for money. <br><br>
                        Parents can sign contracts and receive a lump sum for their child’s work for
                        up to three years.<br>
                        Trafficked children working on Lake Volta can suffer the following: <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don’t have access to education</li>
                        <li>Work longer hours</li>
                        <li>Do more dangerous work</li>
                        <li>Have improper clothing</li>
                        <li>Do not have shelter</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h4 class="title">Possible ways to identify these victims include</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They make no eye contact, hide, or appear physically shaken</li>
                        <li>Do not answer questions directly, look at their master for cues</li>
                        <li>Have injuries or scars</li>
                        <li>Are too far from home to return by themselves</li>
                        <li>Feel compelled to continue helping their family financially</li>
                        <li>Depend on their “employer” for survival</li>
                    </ul>
