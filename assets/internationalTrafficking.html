                        Traffickers – in the form of individuals or agencies – typically exploit
                        Ghanaians looking to earn more money abroad.
                    </p>
                    <p>Often the victims are women.</p>
                    <p>Recruitment agencies can deceive Ghanaian women promising work which is
                        different to the reality of what they’ll do on arrival</p>
                    <p>These unlicensed agencies advertise on radio, television, social media, and
                        newspapers. It can be difficult to work out if agencies are authentic.</p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes victims arrive in Ghana by plane and are then trafficked to other
                        destinations. Ghanaian women are also transported to other parts of Africa
                        (especially Nigeria, Côte D’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, and South
                        Africa) as well as further afield.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another typical scenario is that when promised jobs abroad don't
                        materialise, female victims are forced into to survive or pay their debts to
                        traffickers.

                        In addition to the GPS' anti trafficking unit, these crimes are policed by
                        the Anti-Human Smuggling and Trafficking Unit (AHSTIP) of the Ghana
                        Immigration Service.

                    <h4 class="padding-top-30">Case study</h4>

                    <p>A Ghanaian woman is trafficked to Lebanon where she works for four abusive
                        employers, and then struggles to get home. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Kisi from Ghana wanted work abroad to support her children.</li>
                        <li>She arrived in Lebanon in 2019 to work as a domestic worker, after
                            getting help from an agent.
                        </li>
                        <li>“He told me that Lebanon was a good country and that I wouldn’t have any
                            problems. He told me that I could pay him once I reached Lebanon. He
                            finished the visa process and bought me the air ticket.”
                        </li>
                        <li>Kisi worked for several employers, who all exploited her.</li>
                        <li>Her first employer made her work 17-hour days, with no rest.
                            <ul>
                                <li>She was not allowed to contact her family.</li>
                                <li>She was not paid for three months.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            She moved to a second employer in Lebanon.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Her second employer’s son beat her and threatened to kill her.
                                </li>
                                <li>She was physically abused when she begged to leave.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The third employer required her to clean four homes.</li>
                        <li>Kisi’s fourth employer felt threatened after her husband commented on
                            Kisi’s figure. Kisi was then allowed one meal per day, at most.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Kisi recalls: “She (her employer) told me that she was afraid I
                                    could lure her husband away from her.”
                                </li>
                                <li>When the couple fought, Kisi was not allowed any food.</li>
                                <li>For almost six months, Kisi was not paid.</li>

                            </ul>

                        </li>
                        <li>Between each employer, Kisi would return to the recruitment agency
                            office. There she was severely underfed.
                        </li>
                        <li>She said: “I learned from the other women there that they intentionally
                            starve women so that they become so desperate that they agree to leave
                            the office and work as soon as a job offer comes”.
                        </li>
                        <li>Kisi was desperate to return to Ghana. The agency told her father he
                            would have to pay $10,500 for her to leave. “I was told there was no way
                            I would return home.”
                        </li>
                        <li>Kisi received help from an NGO who contacted her employer.</li>
                        <li>She was then subjected to verbal and physical abuse.</li>
                        <li>Her agent threatened to jail her, and her employer claimed they could
                            get her father in Ghana killed.
                        </li>
                        <li>After lengthy negotiations, the employer paid Kisi four months’ worth of
                            salary and sent her back to the agent, who locked her in a room for a
                            week and confiscated her phone.
                        </li>
                        <li>Since her employer had not paid her for more than three consecutive
                            months, they had broken her two-year contract. This gave her the right
                            to leave. She was allowed to travel back to Ghana once her family bought
                            her ticket.
                        </li>
