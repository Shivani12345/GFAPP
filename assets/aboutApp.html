                        There are many forms of this crime.<br>
                        They all share basic characteristics:

                    <p>
                        When people - often the young, and often women - are traded or treated like
                        foods. Under Ghanaian law, people who do this are criminals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But these are often very difficult crimes to investigate and prosecute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The police - which even have a specialist trafficking unit - don't have
                        resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And trafficking crimes are often committed in a context of extreme poverty.
                        This means the victims, or the family, become willing accomplices. With no
                        money or food, they agree to abused financially or physically.

                        The Ghanaian law regulating these crimes is the 2005 Human Trafficking Act
                        (2005).

                        The Act has a clear definition of human trafficking:

                        <p>

                            receipt of persons for the purpose of exploitation within and across
