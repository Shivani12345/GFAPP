                Traffickers – in the form of individuals or agencies – typically exploit Ghanaians looking to earn more money abroad.
              </p>
              <p>Often the victims are women.</p>
              <p>Recruitment agencies can deceive Ghanaian women promising work which is different to the reality of what they’ll do on arrival</p>
              <p>These unlicensed agencies advertise on radio, television, social media, and newspapers. It can be difficult to work out if agencies are authentic.</p>
              <p>
                Sometimes victims arrive in Ghana by plane and are then  trafficked to other destinations. Ghanaian women are also transported to other parts of Africa (especially Nigeria, Côte D’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, and South Africa) as well as further afield.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another typical scenario is that when promised jobs abroad don't materialise, female victims are forced into to survive or pay their debts to traffickers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the GPS' anti trafficking unit, these crimes are policed by the Anti-Human Smuggling and Trafficking Unit (AHSTIP) of the Ghana Immigration Service.
